        * The title and the description of the issue should be clear and long enough to be descriptive.
        * Please try to no assign the issue more than 2 people unless there is an exceptional situation.
        * You should add the progress changes, updates, etc. to the issue as comments.
        * You should track the suggestions, comments under the issue and respond to them if necessary.
        * Every issue should be labeled. You should select suitable labels before creating the issue. The 'status-new' and 'priority-medium' labels are added as default. You can also change/remove them if you need.
        * The person who will close an issue should put a final comment before closing it.
        * All progress indicator labels (such as status-in progress) should be removed (or be replaced with completed indicator labels) before closing an issue.
        * Dependent issues should be linked by writing #{issue_number}. With the help of this notation, issues will have reference info under themselves to the other related ones.
        * If you don't use some form fields, do not forget to delete them after the issue is created.
