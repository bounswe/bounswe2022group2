* ### Learning weekly tasks
    Weekly tasks are being assigned in our meetings. These tasks can be checked from our meeting notes or our Discord channel if needed.
    
* ### Creating issues for tasks
    Every member should create corresponding issues for their given tasks. If a task is required to have more than 1 people to work in, then a "super" issue should be created and a checklist should be added in it for tracking the progress. Then, a reviewer should review and close the issue when the task is completed.
    
* ### Adding weekly efforts to personal wiki pages
     At the end of every week, every member should add their weekly efforts to their personal wiki pages.
