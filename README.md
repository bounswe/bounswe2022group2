# ❓ What should our members do?

* ### Attending weekly meetings

    All members are expected to attend the weekly meetings and participate in discussions. For when the weekly meetings occur, please refer to our [Communication Plan](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2022group2/wiki/Communication-Plan).

* ### Learning weekly tasks

    Weekly tasks are being assigned in our meetings. These tasks can be checked from our meeting notes or our Discord channel if needed.

* ### Creating issues for tasks

    Every member should create corresponding issues for their given tasks. If a task is required to have more than 1 person to work on, then a "super" issue should be created and a checklist should be added in it for tracking the progress. Then, a reviewer should review and close the issue when the task is completed.

* ### Adding weekly efforts to personal wiki pages

     At the end of every week, every member should add their weekly efforts to their personal wiki pages.
