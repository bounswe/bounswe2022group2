### *Member:*  

Name: Altay Acar

Group: Group2 - Frontend Team

### *Responsibilities:*

  1. Designing the logo of our app and determining the typeface and color scheme that is used throughout the app.
  2. Building the main structure and layout of authentication pages.
  3. Implementing the sign up page.
  4. Implementing the validation check for the sign up form.
  5. Implementing the backend connection between the sign up page and our REST API.
  6. Implementing unit tests for the sign up page.
  7. Conducting research on React libraries, frameworks, and methodologies that will be used during our development process.
  8. Providing methods for validation.
  9. Providing methods for backend connection.
  10. Reviewing the works done by the frontend team.

### *Main contributions:*

I am a member of our fronend team for the development of our application, namely Learnify. Generally, I took the responsibility of visual side of our web application. For that extent I have designed our logo, provided and appropriate typeface and color scheme using Adobe applications. Then, I have provided the general layout and structure of our authentication pages with appropriate theme. I was also responsible for the implementation of the sign up page from the scratch. Since any of us in the frontend team is not used to work with React,I have conducted very detailed research on how to connect pages, how to uses states, how to validate form inputs, how to handle API requests, and how to do unit testing. In the light of my findings I have implemented our sign up page: First the initial structure and layout, then the validation, then the backend connection, and last the unit testing. Additionaly I took care of the dockerization of our web application's frontend.

### *Member:*  

Name: Ezgi Aysel Batı  

Group: Group2 - Mobile Team

### *Responsibilities:*

  1. Implementing forget password screen and backend connection for mobile.
  2. Implementing Course Preview widget which is the main component of mobile home page.
  3. Implementing unit & widget tests.
  4. Reviewing and testing work done by other mobile team members.
  5. Revising Requirements & UML design related to User-Lecture interactions
  6. Writing System Manual for Mobile.
  7. Learning flutter, flutter testing. 


### *Main contributions:*

As a member of the mobile team, my first priority was to learn flutter and keep researching about it every step of the way in order to come up with the best possible implementation. I worked on implementing the forgot password screen, its connection to the backend endpoint send verification code and also unit/widget tests. I also worked on creating a custom part that displays a preview of courses, which will be the main part of home page. This process involved experimenting with different designs and trying out different combination of components to come up with something that both works nicely and is pleasing visually.   
I attended all lectures, ps'es, mobile & general team meetings. I participated actively especially regarding future planning. I had no prior knowledge of flutter or mobile development.

### *Member:*  

Name: Batuhan Çelik 

Group: Group2 - Backend Team

### *Responsibilities:*

  1. Building the main structure of the Node Js project.
  2. Implementing core components: Mongoose loader, Express loader, in-memory database for testing.
  3. Preparing detailed action plan for project 1.
  4. Implementing sign up endpoint.
  5. Writing tests of the sign up endpoint.
  6. Creating the api definition for auth endpoints.
  7. Dockerizing the Backend.
  8. Connecting a docker-compose file to serve the backend container with a MongoDB container alongside.
  9. Overvising the frontend dockerization and integration to project docker-compose structure.
  10. Deploying the project to the AWS using EC2 and maintaining it.
  11. Reviewing work of backend team members.  

### *Main contributions:*

I took an active part in team management: came up with the project plan, talked with the customer personally to create a feasible plan, designed API definition and project architecture with Bahrican while keeping needs of front and backend in mind. I created the server implementation structure editing the practice-app's structure. I set up the connecting to database process such that it recognizes when it should use docker network, connect to and actual server and create a in-memory volatile database for testing purposes. After creating the development environment for backend, I implemented the signup endpoint with its tests. After it is implemented I used it as a base case to implement the docker file for the backend and optimized it for fast building. Then created a docker compose file to connect my container to a MongoDB container using docker network. After the dockerization of backend is complete, working with Altay, I took part in dockerization of the frontend. Then, set up the EC2 instance with Ellastic IP and required security settings. Since we do not have github actions, I became the github actions myself via being online and taking action whenever a hardfix is needed(I am the only one with the EC2 instance access since noone asked for access and requested for changes from me instead). After those ended, I implemented a migration and mock courses endpoint to add mockup data to the database and from provide dataflow  from database to mocking pages.

On top of that, I was active in all of the meetings and PSes.

### *Additional information:*  

I built the base file, folder structure on mobile project. We have decided to use MVVM design pattern while implementing the project and I created a base structure for it. I have informed my teammates about the user flow we should follow.

I actively participated in and give suggestions about the endpoints we should have. I also give suggestions about the request and response bodies of the endpoints. I explained some concepts and real-life examples of the front designs both for web and mobile. I contributed to the logic we should implement in the authentication flow (signup-login-forgot password-email verification)
