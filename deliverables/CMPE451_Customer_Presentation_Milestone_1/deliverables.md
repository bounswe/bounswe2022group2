## Individual Contributions Report

--------------------------  

### *Member:*  

Name: Bahrican Yeşil  
Group: Group2 - Mobile Team

### *Responsibilities:*

  1. Building the main structure of the Flutter project
  2. Implementing core managers: network, navigation, and local storage managers
  3. Adding multi-theme and multi-language structure base.
  4. Implementing sign up screen, making its back-end connection
  5. Writing tests of the sign up screen
  6. Implementing static profile screen
  7. Writing tests of the profile screen
  8. Make the app icon as our logo and configure the app name
  9. Implementing bottom navigation and app bars
  10. Reviewing all works done by mobile teammates  

### *Main contributions:*

I especially contributed to the mobile side with Flutter since I am a part of the mobile team. I have set up the base project, implemented the base managers (network, navigation, local), base widgets and logics which appear at almost every part of the app (like extensions, common widgets, helpers). I also took the responsibility of the signup and profile (static) screens and implemented them successfully. I did a research on testing with Flutter and I wrote the tests of the screens I developed. These tests created helpful examples for my teammates to use.

### *Additional information:*  

I built the base file, folder structure on mobile project. We have decided to use MVVM design pattern while implementing the project and I created a base structure for it. I have informed my teammates about the user flow we should follow.

I actively participated in and give suggestions about the endpoints we should have. I also give suggestions about the request and response bodies of the endpoints. I explained some concepts and real-life examples of the front designs both for web and mobile. I contributed to the logic we should implement in the authentication flow (signup-login-forgot password-email verification)
