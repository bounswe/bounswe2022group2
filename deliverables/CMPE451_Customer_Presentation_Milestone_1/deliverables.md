### *Member:*  

Name: Bahrican Yeşil  
Group: Group2 - Mobile Team

### *Responsibilities:*

  1. Building the main structure of the Flutter project
  2. Implementing core managers: network, navigation, and local storage managers
  3. Adding multi-theme and multi-language structure base.
  4. Implementing sign up screen, making its back-end connection

  7. Writing tests of the profile screen
  8. Make the app icon as our logo and configure the app name
  9. Implementing bottom navigation and app bars

### *Main contributions:*

I especially contributed to the mobile side with Flutter since I am a part of the mobile team. I have set up the base project, implemented the base managers (network, navigation, local), base widgets and logics which appear at almost every part of the app (like extensions, common widgets, helpers). I also took the responsibility of the signup and profile (static) screens and implemented them successfully. I did a research on testing with Flutter and I wrote the tests of the screens I developed. These tests created helpful examples for my teammates to use.

### *Additional information:*  

I built the base file, folder structure on mobile project. We have decided to use MVVM design pattern while implementing the project and I created a base structure for it. I have informed my teammates about the user flow we should follow.

I actively participated in and give suggestions about the endpoints we should have. I also give suggestions about the request and response bodies of the endpoints. I explained some concepts and real-life examples of the front designs both for web and mobile. I contributed to the logic we should implement in the authentication flow (signup-login-forgot password-email verification)

### *Member:*  

Name: Batuhan Çelik 

Group: Group2 - Backend Team

### *Responsibilities:*

  1. Building the main structure of the Node Js project.
  2. Implementing core components: Mongoose loader, Express loader, in-memory database for testing.
  3. Preparing detailed action plan for project 1.
  4. Implementing sign up endpoint.
  5. Writing tests of the sign up endpoint.
  6. Creating the api definition for auth endpoints.
  7. Dockerizing the Backend.
  8. Connecting a docker-compose file to serve the backend container with a MongoDB container alongside.
  9. Overvising the frontend dockerization and integration to project docker-compose structure.
  10. Deploying the project to the AWS using EC2 and maintaining it.
  11. Reviewing work of backend team members.  

### *Main contributions:*

I took an active part in team management: came up with the project plan, talked with the customer personally to create a feasible plan, designed API definition and project architecture with Bahrican while keeping needs of front and backend in mind. I created the server implementation structure editing the practice-app's structure. I set up the connecting to database process such that it recognizes when it should use docker network, connect to and actual server and create a in-memory volatile database for testing purposes. After creating the development environment for backend, I implemented the signup endpoint with its tests. After it is implemented I used it as a base case to implement the docker file for the backend and optimized it for fast building. Then created a docker compose file to connect my container to a MongoDB container using docker network. After the dockerization of backend is complete, working with Altay, I took part in dockerization og the frontend. Then, set up the EC2 instance with Ellastic IP and required security settings. Since we do not have github actions, I became the github actions myself via being online and taking action whenever a hardfix is needed. After those ended, I implemented a migration and mock courses endpoint to provide dataflow from database to mocking pages.

On top of that, I was active in all of the meetings and PSes.
