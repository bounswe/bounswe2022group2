## Executive Summary

Our application is an online learning platform named Learnify, where learning is accomplished through collaboration. Our application name comes from the words Learn and Unify. Each user can add their expertise to the learning space on our platform by adding any content, comments, notes, or even annotations to the already-existing learning materials. The application is not based on teachers and students, it has a forum  where the users who take part a learning space can share their thoughts and recommendation.There are also annotation available for learning space contents so the users can take notes and reminders for theirselves and other users. This features provide ultimate collaboration on learning spaces. Our application works on mobile and web platforms. The current status of our application is that it supports sing-up, login, email verification, forgot password and resend email verification code features. These were the requirements we aimed to implement for Milestone-1.

## Evaluation of Deliverables

#### Software Requirements Specification

In the first two weeks of this term, we updated and changed our requirements according to the customers feedback. For now, software requirements specification is finalized. Software requirements specification now include whole features that are required to implemented and included. It is a crucial document to prevent misunderstanding about any features among team members. It should be checking during the development process.

#### Software Design (UML)

_Use case diagram_ includes whole use case scenarios for all types of users. From that UML, people can understand the concept and logic of the software. The location of the pages and navigation among them is derived from the use case diagram. This information is used in implementation stage.<br>

_Class diagram_ clarify the structure of classes in software. It includes classes, their methods and relations with other classes. This UML is beneficial for backend implementation. We are also benefitted from this diagram.<br>

_Sequence diagram_ has several use case scenarios. For each scenarios, it calls methods and gives responses. It is kind of concatenation of use case and class diagram. We used them when requests and responses occurred.<br>

Whole UML’s are also updated in the first two week of the term according to the changes in the requirements specification.

#### Scenarios and Mockups

For the sake of collaborative learning mindset across platform, we think that users can be both learner and lecturer. So, there won’t be any separate user types in our software. The scenarios and mockups that we made in the last semester won't fit in that requirement. So, in the customer presentation, we modified the scenarios. However, mockups generally satisfy our requirements.<br>

In the customer presentation, our first scenario was about unregistered user. User sign ups and receives verification code. S/he is redirected to the verification page. Verification code is entered and user is now in the app. S/he views the home page and log out. After that s/he tries to log in and successfully log in. This scenario is also showed in mobile app. In addition to that, since profile page was implemented in the mobile app, user navigate to the profile page and take a photo of himself/herself. And change the profile photo.<br>

With this scenarios, wrong inputs and their response messages are also shown to the customer. At the end, scenarios and mockups have great impact on the customer. It is kind of an evidence of the progress.

#### Project Plan

Project plan prioritize and schedules the whole term. We can say it is like a process scheduling in an operation system. We divide our work and distribute them evenly. In this way, in a relatively short period of time, lots of work will done simultaneously. And also, there won't be much work right before the deadlines and we don't miss any tasks during development. By this way, having a project plan is the most convenient thing to keep track of the progress as well.

#### Individual Contributions Reports

Individual Contributions Reports have been filled with all the work done by each of our group members since the beginning of this semester. It is built as an index-like structure that enables you to access the detail of any issue mentioned or any pull request made by any of our group members. It shows a comprehensive summary of the work done throughout this semester.

Each team member writes just about their work and the whole part was constructed by all of us.

#### Software

The software product that we have been working on is prepared within the goals determined in the project plan for Milestone 1. Three legs of our team have managed to meet the goals for Milestone 1, so we have a fully working, dockerized, and deployed frontend and backend. We also presented our deployed, working project in class during demo sessions without any fault or bug.

We started to implement the project after deciding on our design criteria and separating the team into sub-teams at the beginning of the semester. Then we started implementing the project within separate teams but constantly communicating with each other.

#### Mobile Deliverables (APK and Manual)

In addition to the work done by the backend and frontend teams, the mobile team also provided a fully working mobile application and managed to present during in-class demos. The mobile team has also provided a manual to those that are eager to use the app on their local android environments.

The mobile team started to implement their projects after the same process that is mentioned under the Software section and prepared a manual.

#### Group Review

Group Review is the work that is currently done by the team as the final work of Milestone 1. We both evaluate the ongoing project, the tools that have been used, the status of our deliverables, the team members, and the part of the milestone that we have completed so far.

---------

## Evaluation of Tools and Processes

### ~ Evaluation of Tools ~

#### **1. General**

We used so many different tools while we are developing the project. Since in this term we have divided into different sub-teams, the number, and variety of the tools we used also increased. When we are having a conversation about choosing a tool for development, we considered several points. We can say that one of the most significant items that we considered is that the tool has to enable us to work collaboratively and to track each other easily in an organized way. Another thing we considered is the use of the tool. The reason behind this consideration is the fact that we have so limited time to develop the project. Therefore, having familiarity with the tool will be a good advantage for all of us.

#### **2. Discord**

We used Discord as our main communication tool. All team meetings including the sub-team meetings were held via the voice channels we created. We have created a different voice and text channels for different needs such as meeting notes, mobile team, front-team, back-team, research material, and general and random chats. We found Discord to be useful as our main communication tool since it is easy to use and many of us were already familiar with it. Having multiple voice channels in the same group and being able to separate text channels were the main features that we benefit from.

Besides these, using threads to separate messages within the same text channel (such as having a new thread for each meeting or research topic) made our channel easy to navigate and organized. Overall, Discord provided all the basic features we required from a team communication environment. All team members were able to organize, see and track the notes, and texts written under the channels.

#### **3. GitHub**

The GitHub repository is where all progress made as well as all the deliverables can be viewed. Our whole code is stored under GitHub and we are managing our code base with the help of Git&GitHub. Our repository provides a portfolio of all the work we have done. It includes information about who we are and all the design and research we have done in the wiki section. It includes information about what should be expected from the project we are developing and also who has done what via the regularly created and maintained issues. Additionally, since we started the real-implementation of the real project we assigned (Online Learning Platform), the whole code of the project is in the project repository.

GitHub is the most important tool we are using during the development of the project. The reason for this is the fact that it gathers everything we have done in one place including not only the code lines but also the documents, deliverables, meeting notes, and so on. Almost all types of work we have done include Github in one way, every task of design, documentation, research, assignment tracking, and even reviews include and can be reached from our GitHub repository.

We are also actively using the version control aspects of Github such as committing changes and merging branches. We actively opened issues for the work we will do, we held the development processes under branches we created. We opened pull requests after each development, got a review (at least 1 with the help of branch protection we set), and merged firstly to dev and then master.

We found Github to be useful for this purpose as it contains every feature we needed for such a tracking and management system. Also, it has good user interaction for both the contributors and outsiders observing. Alternatives such as BitBucket provide similar features for version management but we find Github is more useful in terms of merging version control and information wiki together in one space.

#### **4. Flutter**

We conducted research on Flutter before we decided to use it for mobile development. Here are our findings and reasonings to choose Flutter as the tool for Mobile development:

1. Flutter is based on Dart language which is so similar to Java. Since we all took beginner-level courses in the department with Java and learned the programming basics with Java, using Dart will not be a problem for us, and the adaptation process will be easy for us.
2. In Flutter, the visual (UI) and logic parts of the code are included in the one-single code base. This fact eases and speeds up the coding. In the end, we can reach MVP and the aimed version of the app in a shorter time compared to other technologies.
3. Normally, it is expected to performance decrease in cross-platform technologies. Even though Flutter has also some downgrades, it serves near-to-native performance in most cases with the help of the Dart compiler since it converts the Flutter app to native code. In the end, we are able to use the native features.
4. We are building a huge app with lots of features and so with lots of screens, UI components, widgets, and so on. This brings up complexity and difficulty of implementation. However, Flutter gives various UI components as in-built support and you can use all of them as just widgets. Besides this, its package system ([pub.dev](https://pub.dev/)) has lots of free open-source packages that include various design/logic solutions for apps.
5. Flutter has a hot-reload feature with a very fast reloading time. This feature will be very useful in the development and debugging process!
6. We have experienced people with Flutter, this will speed up our development and we will be able to implement almost all features with good design and code patterns in the given time (1 semester).
7. We have people who are very curious about Flutter and want to learn it. This curiosity and desire to learn will carry us forward when we start to code the project.

After the first milestone demo, we understood that we gave the correct decision by choosing Flutter. We were able to quickly develop the first milestone with lots of good features, nice design touches, and fewer problems. People in the mobile team who have curious about Flutter but have no experience got the initial experience. According to their feedback in our team meetings, we are satisfied with the development experience with Flutter.

#### **5. NodeJS**

We choosed to implement our application on NodeJS keeping following in mind.

1- We already have implemented our practice app in Node.JS, thus, members were educated on the stack. We have already completed courses on REST API implementation on NodeJS. Moreover, we already have a base project to use with some cool features readily implemented like in memory test database from our test API.

2- It is considerably more lightweight compared to its closest competitor(Python) during our research, since we will be using a free tier EC2 instance, we try to keep our CPU usage low as much as possible.

3- It is a well established stack, meaning it will be more reliable than other suggestions like FastAPI(which is still in alpha).

4- There is a huge community of NodeJs, thus, a huge community support and lots of out of the box packages for DB access, data validation, etc.

The last point was the actual reason we have gone with the NodeJS and during our implementation we enjoyed being able to Google every bug we encountered.

#### **6. Docker and the DockerHub**

As the our team has grew and divided, setting up the apps on everyone's local environments was not feasible, so we dockerized our database, backend, and frontend via collecting all containers in a single dockerfile. This is especially helpful with EC2 instances because they come with virtually no software installed on Ubuntu. However, one problem with docker being we use more than 3000 packages for our frontend, thus, each docker build requires a considerable computation power which consumes almost all the CPU credits on our EC2 instance. This is where DockerHub comes into the picture. We created docker images on our personal computers and uploaded images to the DockerHub to be used on our EC2 instance. In the next stages of the project we plan to make it so all members can access to all containers on DockerHub.

Our docker images are private on Dockerhub because they come with bash installed, so if we made them public, anyone on the internet can access to our API keys(like the one we use to connect to our Gmail Address).

#### **7. AWS: EC2 and Cloudwatch**

Both of our apps, practice app and Learnify, are deployed on free EC2 instances with their databases alongside. Only interface our EC2 machines provide are through API's and there is no way to directly access the databases, keeping our data safe and square. Instance's ssh settings are on default, so that shh connection can be established only using a .pem file.

One crucial mistake we have been made last semester was not keeping an eye on our instance monitoring which resulted in a 10$ bill. Therefore, this semester we introduced AWS Cloudwatch to our system. Cloudwatch is a monitoring tool provided by AWS that checks our instance's CPU usage, CPU credit(amount of CPU time our free instance has left) and runtime. We set the cloudwatch so that if we ever get close to the billing range, it will shut down the server automatically, keeping us safe in the free-tier zone.

#### **8. Gmail**

We needed a mail account to send our verification mails. This comes with some complications since logging in to a mail account as a person(performing a Captcha check) is a lot simpler than logging in to a mail account as a bot. Most providers require you to set a development account and store some keys for OAuth2 authentication. However, Google implemented a quite developer friendly system named Application Password. Their working process is in the following: You generate an application password from Gmail web interface then use that password to perform OAauth1 authentication. Then the password is set for your MAC address and your application can log in to Gmail using its MAC and Application Password pair. This requires generating a new application password for each device our server will run but generating one for the server and 3 for backend memebers were sufficient since mobile and front teams directly interacted with the API set up on EC2 instance.

## Review the Milestone

---------

### ~ Against Objectives ~

---------

### ~ Progress ~

With the start of the semester, we have started the development of our application Learnify. Learnify is an online learning platform, which aims to create a collaborative learning space for all the users. Although we have successfully completed the design and planning phases of our project last semester, we needed to revise most of the design before starting the development. We have divided into three teams, which have worked on separate parts of our application. Frontend team worked on the web application, mobile team worked on the mobile application, and the backend team worked on the development of our RESTful API. At the beginning of our development phase we have updated our communication plan and project plan according to the needs and aims of the scope of our project. We have welcomed new members. Every week we have held a customer meeting, in which we discussed the current state of our project and in the following a general group meeting where everyone participated and the tasks are identified for the next week. Every development team also held their own meetings each week to meet the objectives of our application’s development.

For the milestone 1, we have aimed to have a fully functioning authentication part of our application. After discussing with our customer, we have decided to have e-mail verification for a registered user. Also, when a user forgets their password, they can also reset their password via e-mail verification. For the demonstration purposes, a static mockup homepage also can be seen after successfully signing in to our application. To develop every related part of the project each team collaboratively worked together and before Milestone 1 every feature, page, and screen was implemented, tested, dockerized, and deployed as planned. We have effectively used React and some external libraries for frontend, Flutter for mobile, Node.js for the backend, Docker for dockerization, and AWS for the deployment.

---------

### ~ What went well? ~

There are some areas where we, as a team, have been quite successful in dealing with the challenges we faced from the beginning of the term to the milestone delivery. First of all, since everyone on the team, including our newly joined teammates, worked diligently and in accordance with the project plan throughout the entire development process, and completed the tasks assigned to them in a timely and thorough manner, all the components we implemented worked perfectly during the milestone presentation. Secondly, we were also able to provide the deliverables asked by the instructors before the deadline they set to us as a natural result of the fact that all members of the group were able to finish their job on time. Moreover, despite the fact that we had to be divided into 3 separate groups at the beginning of the semester according to the needs of our project as Frontend, Backend and Mobile Teams, all the members in these 3 groups fully participated in both the general meetings and the in-team meetings, showing their commitment to the project and allowing our work to run in line with the project pipeline. In addition, both being able to organize the meetings face-to-face unlike the group meetings held online last semester, and the fact that the team members were in constant communication were very helpful in resolving the problems we encountered during the project implementation as quickly as possible. In addition to the aforementioned, another advantage of our division into 3 separate teams that has been working in different fields was that the general meetings held were completed in a relatively short time instead of taking too long than expected as in the previous semester. Furthermore, we ensured that the branch structure was properly organized, as in the example of master -> dev -> dev/front, so that the permanent modifications we made did not negatively impact each other's work. Finally, unlike all the other teams that made a presentation on the Milestone day, we were able to stay one step ahead, as we managed to implement the email verification page in a way that all the functionality from the backend and the frontend parts would work seamlessly and compatible with each other.

---------

### ~ What did not go well? ~

Even though very few, there are some areas where we, as a team, might have handled better the difficulties we had from the start of the term through the milestone delivery. Firstly, we had to spend a lot of time modifying the requirements we prepared last semester in order to satisfy the needs of the new client since our instructor, who served as the customer, changed from the term before due to circumstances beyond our control. Secondly, because of the unavoidable changes in the requirements, we were forced to update all of the software designs we had previously created. Additionally, because we had to spent our time discussing how the new diagrams we had made should function, we were unable to use that valuable time for other more productive tasks. Moreover, we may have been able to lessen the pressure of having to provide the deliverables in the final few days before the deadline if we had only taken a little more time to prepare the Milestone report. In addition, although all three of the teams we formed were able to do the necessary unit tests on time, we left the unit testing to the relatively later stages of the project development phases, so there was some concern among the team members in the final days before the milestone delivery on whether or not we could complete them on time. Finally, although we managed to create frontend and mobile pages in a timely manner with an eye-catching and visually impressive design, the initial learning processes and code implementations of these parts took a little longer than expected, as most of the Frontend and Mobile team members were working with tools they had never experienced before.
