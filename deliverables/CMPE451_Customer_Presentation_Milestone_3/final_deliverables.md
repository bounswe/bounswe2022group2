### Summary of the Project Status

Learnify is an online platform that enables collaborative learning. We finished almost all portions of our project and deployed the web application, which can be accessed through a [public IP address](http://3.76.176.35/). The mobile application also can be installed using an apk file can be found [here](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2022group2/wiki/Learnify-Mobile-APK) or alternatively you can create an APK with the last version by following the guideline [here](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2022group2/wiki/System-Manual).
