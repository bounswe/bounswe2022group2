### *Main Contributions:*

I am a member of our frontend team for the development of our application, namely Learnify. As I did in the first milestone, I continued to provide visual components of our web application according to the design guidelines we have determined together and in harmony with other components and pages of our web application. Before our weekly frontend team meetings I have regularly inspected our application's development's current state and provided necessary agenda for that week. I have also provided page layouts and visual components like icons, logos, or illustrations for our web application. I have also researched on icon library that we can use (Fontawesome) and implemented it so that the performance and loading times for our screens increase significantly by not trying to render each png file when loading. I have also researched n dynamic routing in React and provided an easy-to-use and effective solution to one of our biggest issues: overcoming hardcoding each url path in App.js. I have also provided a component based page layouting logic so that we can eaily import components and use them withouut repeating lines of code and be able to pass specific parameters to display components. Besides, I have implemented categories page, learning spaces by category page and semantic search component in the navigation bar. For each, I have implemented separate components, established backend connection, established dynamic routing and passed parameters to display components according to the response acquired from the REST API. I have also regularly provided css classes that satisfy our design guidelines for the components implemented by the whole frontend team. I have regularly helped my teammates to fix any erroneous part of their code, provided hotfixes, and tried to share them good practices that I have learned. Additionally, I have implemented unit tests for the components that I have created during the development of our web application’s frontend.

### *Member:*  

Name: Batuhan Çelik

Group: Group2 - Backend Team

### *Responsibilities:*

In the order of time consumption.

1. Perform research about semantic search methods, find a computationally feasible method to add sementic search functionality to our project, implement the semantic search microservice, dockerize the microservice and finally create an endpoint on main app to serve the results.
2. Understand the W3 annotation model and contribute to the system design of the annotations.
3. Find a cost efficient way to deploy our application, since frontend container is huge, free tier EC2 instances were not sufficient to deploy them, so I had to create a multi instance architecture and set up docker-hub for our team.
4. Communicate with the front and backend teams to design the API according to their needs.
5. Implement the API specification determined with the other team members.
6. Database management, add, delete elements and run migrations when requested by other members.
7. Reviewing the works done by the backend team.
8. Solving bugs, errors, problems encountered during the implementation of backend and create hotfixes when needed.
9. Attending and participating general meetings regularly.
10. Organising, attending and participating backend team meetings regularly.

### *Main Contributions:*

As a member of backend team, I established a strong communication with the frontend and backend teams to design an API specification statisfying their needs and complying with the backend development conventions. Of course I took part in implementation of that API.

Most of this milestone went by researching. I had to put in lots of hours to understand different semantic search algorithms and find methods to implement them in our application. I learned about semantic search databases and found some open source implementations (Open semantic search was the most remarkable one), then, deployed them in docker containers just to see the smallest one required at least 4 GBs of memory. Accepting defeat, I looked for an API that would provide BERT encodings to me. Those types of APIs are not frequent since most companies provided whole data processing APIs instead of giving just encodings. This business model is fine for companies but getting this service free is out of question since it is a costly operation. In the end I tried 8 different services to find a solution we can integrate to our application easily.

Besides semantic search, even though I did not contributed code to the annotations part of our application, I gone through the annotation model doccumentation with Ecenur and made sure our interface complied with the model. While ecenur was sick, I was taking care of the annotations part, during this duration, I found some open source implementations to get inspiration from. In the end I contributed to the annotations part with my understanding of the model.

When everything was implemented, we found out that our frontend was too resource hungry to be deployed on a free tier EC2. In addition to that we now had a semantic search microservice. In the end, our system architecture had to be revised. I made those revisions and deployed the new architecture without problems.

### *Main Contributions:*

I am a part of our mobile development team for our application, Learnify. Since the beginning of this semester, we are developing our application step by step. In our first milestone demo, we focused on authentication screens of our application and provided them. Since we had time left after implementing those screens, we started to work on our second milestone screens back then. For our second milestone, we decided to focus on annotations in our mobile application, mostly. So, we divided necessary tasks to our mobile team members and our most experienced member was assigned with annotations, I, on the other hand, was assigned with implementing learning space detail, add post and edit post screens. In summary, for our second milestone demo, I implemented informations part of learning space detail screen, add post screen, edit post screen(with title and content of the post to be edited is already present in corresponding input fields), enroll button and back-end connection for enroll functionality, back-end connection for add post functionality, back-end connection for edit post functionality, back-end connection for getting taken learning spaces, back-end connection for getting all learning spaces, dynamic sizing in learning space detail screen, routing between create learning space and learning space detail screens, post model and necessary request&response models for corresponding back-end connections. During this time, I also tried to solve bugs and review codes written by my teammates, regularly.

### *Main Contributions:*

I am member of the mobile team. I mainly contributed to the tasks that are related to the mobile side of our project. I have implemented several pages that can be seen both above and below. Before implementing the pages, I did detailed research about these pages. I analyzed the example screens. When the widgets have done and endpoints were implemented by our backend team, I analyzed the related endpoints. After that, backend connections of the pages are done if needed. Some pages have to receive data from another pages. So, I do research about data passing in Flutter. I reviewed and tried to understand deeply the works that are done by other mobile team members. I stick with our project plan. Other than these, I have contributed to project management. I opened polls for clarifying our decisions with our team in various things. Also, contributed to some works for our demo like creating learning spaces and posts. Specification of the requirements has great importance of the project development. I asked my detailed questions about our features to our TA. The answers changed our way of thinking of that features in various aspects. Collaborative learning is an example of this. Additionally, I attended to mobile/general team meetings and lessons regularly to keep synchronized with our team and project.

### *Main Contributions:*

I work on the front end of our Learnify application, which is being developed collaboratively by all the members of group 2. I have implemented the text and image annotation features for the frontend part complying with the W3C standards as constantly requested by our teacher in the lectures. I have offered hotfixes, sugggested a few improvements for the parts in my coworkers' code, and attempted to pass along the related information I have discovered. In addition, for the components I developed while working on the front end of our online application like not found page and email verification page, I also performed unit tests to ensure that every component worked as expected. In keeping with the design principles we jointly decided with other frontend members upon and in consistency with other components and pages of our online application, I continued to offer some of the visual components like designs, icons, and buttons of our web application for this milestone 2. I frequently checked the progress of our application's development before our weekly general and frontend team meetings, and suggested some appropriate ideas for our agenda every week. For our frontend application, I have also altered some visual parts of the learning space page post creation and editing parts so as to improve efficiency of our learning space page in terms of the loading duration by changing some of the the png images to svg icons. For our frontend part of the application, I have also given some parts of the page layouts and graphic elements like icons, logos, and drawings along with some alluring designs to support these. In addition, I looked into React's page routing and came up with a simple but effective fix for one of our fundamental problems by implementing private and protected routing, which in essence was to prevent unauthorized users from accessing the internal parts of the application like home page, learning space page, etc. I have also created a component-based page layouting logic for the post feature of the learning space page in order to easily import components, utilize them without duplicating code segments, and be able to give certain parameters with React props to display components. In addition, I added a not found page with an eye-pleasing desgin and built majority of the components and functionalities of the learning space page. Finally, in line with our frontend development, I have created some css classes that comply with our design guidelines for the components implemented by the entire frontend team, as well as implemented separate components for each, established backend connections, established private page routing, and passed parameters to display components according to the response obtained from the REST API.

### *Main Contributions:*

I am one of the members of the front-end team of our application Learnify, as a team of 4 we are implementing the web-application side. Throughout this development process we try not to diverge from the path that we follow for; deciding on "What is next?", sharig the tasks equally among our team members, keeping in touch with the team during the implementation, conducting research when needed, reviewing and commenting on each others work regularly and, finally making sure that our application functions as expected. I have taken responsibiity for all of these development steps time to time. Regularly participated to weekly meetings of our team and shared my point of view for the further developments that can be conducted for our web-application, at the same time those meetings are the time that we share each weeks tasks, so I have shared my mind about load balancing each week and took significant tasks that have effected the development of our application. While keeping in touch with the other team members both for the design and functionality ideas, first of all I have implemented the "Static Navigation Bar" components layout and the functionalty, implemented the layout and several of the components for the Learning Space pages which is one of the main pages of our web-application(where learning and sharing takes place.), contributed to our codebase with several hot-fixes related to the REST API utilization and router modularization. And as I have mentioned above, testing the work we have come up with was one of the important points, as we have done always in our front-end team; we have shared the designs and functionalities that were added and implemented the unit tests for those, my responsibility was to test the Footer component and I did so. Our team was also aware of the importance of conducting research together and share our findings with each other, I have created a research team issue for finding out the annotation technologies and libraries that our team can benefit from and shared my own findings via examples and hyperlinks with my team.

### *Main Contributions:*

I am a member of the mobile team for the development of our application which is Learnify. Therefore, most contributions were on the mobile side. However, I also did significant contributions to the general organization of our repository and the process of the team. I've created a project for our repository under the organization. I have created a pull request template to well-organize the PRs with explanatory descriptions, content details, and issue-closing information (just as I created issue templates in the previous term for CMPE352). I have also created GitHub actions for our Android/Mobile project since this is so important for continuous integration. I have mainly managed our mobile team meetings, I determined our situation and what we need to do before the mobile meetings. I helped to team with feature prioritization, scheduling, and sharing among the mobile team members.

Apart from these management contributions, I mainly took the whole responsibility for the text & image annotations on mobile with their all details. I have both implemented and solved the bugs realized in the development phase. I have also communicated with the back-end team and helped to build the annotation model&endpoints to be compatible with W3C standards. I implemented designs, functionalities, back-end connections, and tests, in short everything for text and image annotations on mobile. So, my main contribution to mobile is annotations.

Apart from the annotations, I implemented the posts section of the learning space detail screen which opened as the default tab view on the screen. I also implemented the event section as static by fetching user data from a 3rd party API temporarily until the back end is ready. I contributed with small but nice touches to the mobile app like page transition animations, a native splash screen, and so on. Other than these, I contributed to the mobile code base with lots of generic widgets used across the app on different screens.

### *Main Contributions:*

I am a member of the front-end team of our application Learnify. As a member of the frontend team, I am proud to say that we have a strong team mentality that is focused on collaboration and communication. Over the past Milestone, I have personally contributed to this team mentality by consistently working closely with my teammates to ensure that we are catching the deadlines and the goals that we have set. During this milestone, first thing that I did is carrying static backend links to an .env file to make it more flexible for any change since the number of backend calls will increase while the application is developing so we need to save it as a variable to use at the different parts of the code. Then to complete authentication related issues, I have created the change password component so we are ready for the feature. Then, we have started the Learning spaces and I took the part where we create the learning spaces. After discussions with backend on what to send from the frontend to create a learning space, I have started from implementing a dropdown list and select component and image selection component. To use these components from the create learning space page, I have worked on the function callback from parent to child components. Then after we complete the design of the page, we have worked on both the connections between the frontend and the backend and connections between the pages that we have implemented. At the end, all of the team and I are focused more on the functionality on the learning space page and offering the contents in the learning space page. I have worked closely with the team members during this process and find ways to show the content that we have from the backend. I have watched out our frontend code base during each pull request and did continious testing during and after each merge and make sure that the system is working in a reliable manner. Also, I have implemented unit tests to the components that I have created.
