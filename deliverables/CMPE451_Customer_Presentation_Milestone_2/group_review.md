## Executive Summary

Learnify is an online learning platform that provides users collaborative spaces. The users can create a learning space and document their expertise by adding any content or notes. The user can also make annotations to other learning spaces to contribute to the platform and specific learning space. The thing is that Learnify trying to accomplish is creating a new platform to everyone can share their comments and recommendations instead of building another kind of teacher-student interaction. Learnify is available on mobile and web platforms. The current status of Learnify is that it supports sign-up, login, email verification, forgot password, resending email verification code, changing password, enrolling learning space, making annotations and editing annotations, creating posts, and editing posts. Learnify also supports semantic search and filtering learning spaces by category. These were the requirements we aimed to implement for Milestone-2 with the new features since Milestone-1.

### User Interface/User Experience

#### Mobile

Note: We structured our folders in a way that they can be managed easily. Therefore, we're giving the link of the folder related to the code part you requested. Please analyze and review them carefully. You can also see the import statements at the beginning of each file and so that you can find the implementations of sub-components in a screen. Please traverse all files included in the directory and also the imported ones and the sub-folders (such as view, model, view-model, constants, and so on) to see our implementations on the code side.

##### Annotating an Image

Note: We implemented annotating image functionality ourselves without using any package or ready-to-use code. We have full control on our code since we didn't use any package. We just got help from a repository which includes manipulation and edit feature on images. However, it doesn't have any annotation-related feature. We just benefit from it for image edit feature (drawing rectangles on an image). We also gave a link to that repository at the beginning of related files. \

### Annotations

#### Status
  
  In our recent status, annotations are supported on both mobile and frontend. In application level, we are able to annotate both images and text. Users can select a specific part of an image and leave a text annotation. Similarly, users can select a piece of text and leave text annotation as well. In both cases, annotated area is highlighted. On mobile, the application connection with specification is also complete. Which means users can re-visit their own and others' annotations anytime they visit a learning space post. On frontend, connection with backend will be implemented on near future, however, annotations are still present on current web session.
  
***
  
#### Standarts
  
  As conventions, annotations are required to be universal, which means that any web client should be able to use existing and create new annotations from/coming to our microservice. To provide this, the annotations should be the W3 Web Annotation Data model. This aspects of annotating is pretty clear on our side. However, for the sake of Milestone 2, the microservice implementation was left to near future. Currently, annotations are stored on learnify servers. The annotations saved on the database follow the W3 Model. The image below is an example of how image and text annotations are stored in our database.

  ![imageannot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64018144/206256739-c0594972-3d76-4b01-b383-0bbaea0965eb.jpg)

  **Text annotation**

  And in this images you can see the models we do follow from W3 model.

 ***

#### Improvements in the Future

   **After our second demo, along with feedback we as a team see clearer on our mistakes on providing the universality and reusability of our annotations and we will do many improvements.**
  These improvements will be:

* Create microservice:

     We will create another service designed just to keep and return annotations and we will access it using axios library.
* Change the request parameters on Create Annotation Endpoint:

     Although the annotations kept in the database and returned to the application fully obeys the W3 annotation model, the model sent by the application to the create annotation endpoint does not follow the same convention. In very near future, the annotation model sent by the application and get by the specification will be exactly the same and will be W3 annotation model.

### *Main Contributions:*

I am a member of our frontend team for the development of our application, namely Learnify. As I did in the first milestone, I continued to provide visual components of our web application according to the design guidelines we have determined together and in harmony with other components and pages of our web application. Before our weekly frontend team meetings I have regularly inspected our application's development's current state and provided necessary agenda for that week. I have also provided page layouts and visual components like icons, logos, or illustrations for our web application. I have also researched on icon library that we can use (Fontawesome) and implemented it so that the performance and loading times for our screens increase significantly by not trying to render each png file when loading. I have also researched n dynamic routing in React and provided an easy-to-use and effective solution to one of our biggest issues: overcoming hardcoding each url path in App.js. I have also provided a component based page layouting logic so that we can eaily import components and use them withouut repeating lines of code and be able to pass specific parameters to display components. Besides, I have implemented categories page, learning spaces by category page and semantic search component in the navigation bar. For each, I have implemented separate components, established backend connection, established dynamic routing and passed parameters to display components according to the response acquired from the REST API. I have also regularly provided css classes that satisfy our design guidelines for the components implemented by the whole frontend team. I have regularly helped my teammates to fix any erroneous part of their code, provided hotfixes, and tried to share them good practices that I have learned. Additionally, I have implemented unit tests for the components that I have created during the development of our web application’s frontend.

### *Main Contributions:*
I am a part of our mobile development team for our application, Learnify. Since the beginning of this semester, we are developing our application step by step. In our first milestone demo, we focused on authentication screens of our application and provided them. Since we had time left after implementing those screens, we started to work on our second milestone screens back then. For our second milestone, we decided to focus on annotations in our mobile application, mostly. So, we divided necessary tasks to our mobile team members and our most experienced member was assigned with annotations, I, on the other hand, was assigned with implementing learning space detail, add post and edit post screens. In summary, for our second milestone demo, I implemented informations part of learning space detail screen, add post screen, edit post screen(with title and content of the post to be edited is already present in corresponding input fields), enroll button and back-end connection for enroll functionality, back-end connection for add post functionality, back-end connection for edit post functionality, back-end connection for getting taken learning spaces, back-end connection for getting all learning spaces, dynamic sizing in learning space detail screen, routing between create learning space and learning space detail screens, post model and necessary request&response models for corresponding back-end connections. During this time, I also tried to solve bugs and review codes written by my teammates, regularly.

 * Create LS Screen tests have not been merged to the master branch as the futureInit() function used in this screen causes automated tests to fail. After 7-8 hours and 300+ lines of bug fixing attempts I gave up on it. The screen works and the tests are written properly. They just fail automated testing.

### *Main Contributions:*

I am one of the members of the front-end team of our application Learnify, as a team of 4 we are implementing the web-application side. Throughout this development process we try not to diverge from the path that we follow for; deciding on "What is next?", sharig the tasks equally among our team members, keeping in touch with the team during the implementation, conducting research when needed, reviewing and commenting on each others work regularly and, finally making sure that our application functions as expected. I have taken responsibiity for all of these development steps time to time. Regularly participated to weekly meetings of our team and shared my point of view for the further developments that can be conducted for our web-application, at the same time those meetings are the time that we share each weeks tasks, so I have shared my mind about load balancing each week and took significant tasks that have effected the development of our application. While keeping in touch with the other team members both for the design and functionality ideas, first of all I have implemented the "Static Navigation Bar" components layout and the functionalty, implemented the layout and several of the components for the Learning Space pages which is one of the main pages of our web-application(where learning and sharing takes place.), contributed to our codebase with several hot-fixes related to the REST API utilization and router modularization. And as I have mentioned above, testing the work we have come up with was one of the important points, as we have done always in our front-end team; we have shared the designs and functionalities that were added and implemented the unit tests for those, my responsibility was to test the Footer component and I did so. Our team was also aware of the importance of conducting research together and share our findings with each other, I have created a research team issue for finding out the annotation technologies and libraries that our team can benefit from and shared my own findings via examples and hyperlinks with my team.

### *Main Contributions:*

I am a member of the mobile team for the development of our application which is Learnify. Therefore, most contributions were on the mobile side. However, I also did significant contributions to the general organization of our repository and the process of the team. I've created a project for our repository under the organization. I have created a pull request template to well-organize the PRs with explanatory descriptions, content details, and issue-closing information (just as I created issue templates in the previous term for CMPE352). I have also created GitHub actions for our Android/Mobile project since this is so important for continuous integration. I have mainly managed our mobile team meetings, I determined our situation and what we need to do before the mobile meetings. I helped to team with feature prioritization, scheduling, and sharing among the mobile team members.

Apart from these management contributions, I mainly took the whole responsibility for the text & image annotations on mobile with their all details. I have both implemented and solved the bugs realized in the development phase. I have also communicated with the back-end team and helped to build the annotation model&endpoints to be compatible with W3C standards. I implemented designs, functionalities, back-end connections, and tests, in short everything for text and image annotations on mobile. So, my main contribution to mobile is annotations.

Apart from the annotations, I implemented the posts section of the learning space detail screen which opened as the default tab view on the screen. I also implemented the event section as static by fetching user data from a 3rd party API temporarily until the back end is ready. I contributed with small but nice touches to the mobile app like page transition animations, a native splash screen, and so on. Other than these, I contributed to the mobile code base with lots of generic widgets used across the app on different screens.

### *Main Contributions:*

I am a member of the front-end team of our application Learnify. As a member of the frontend team, I am proud to say that we have a strong team mentality that is focused on collaboration and communication. Over the past Milestone, I have personally contributed to this team mentality by consistently working closely with my teammates to ensure that we are catching the deadlines and the goals that we have set. During this milestone, first thing that I did is carrying static backend links to an .env file to make it more flexible for any change since the number of backend calls will increase while the application is developing so we need to save it as a variable to use at the different parts of the code. Then to complete authentication related issues, I have created the change password component so we are ready for the feature. Then, we have started the Learning spaces and I took the part where we create the learning spaces. After discussions with backend on what to send from the frontend to create a learning space, I have started from implementing a dropdown list and select component and image selection component. To use these components from the create learning space page, I have worked on the function callback from parent to child components. Then after we complete the design of the page, we have worked on both the connections between the frontend and the backend and connections between the pages that we have implemented. At the end, all of the team and I are focused more on the functionality on the learning space page and offering the contents in the learning space page. I have worked closely with the team members during this process and find ways to show the content that we have from the backend. I have watched out our frontend code base during each pull request and did continious testing during and after each merge and make sure that the system is working in a reliable manner. Also, I have implemented unit tests to the components that I have created.
