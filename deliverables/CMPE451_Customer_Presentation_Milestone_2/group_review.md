***
  
### Status of the Deliverables of Milestone 1

***

### Progress According to Requirements

***

### API Endpoints

***

### User Interface / User Experience

***

### Annotations

#### Status
  
  In our recent status, annotations are supported on both mobile and frontend. In application level, we are able to annotate both images and text. Users can select a specific part of an image and leave a text annotation. Similarly, users can select a piece of text and leave text annotation as well. In both cases, annotated area is highlighted. On mobile, the application connection with specification is also complete. Which means users can re-visit their own and others' annotations anytime they visit a learning space post. On frontend, connection with backend will be implemented on near future, however, annotations are still present on current web session. 
  
***
  
#### Standarts
  
  As conventions, annotations are required to be universal, which means that any web client should be able to use existing and create new annotations from/coming to our microservice. To provide this, the annotations should be the W3 Web Annotation Data model. This aspects of annotating is pretty clear on our side. However, for the sake of Milestone 2, the microservice implementation was left to near future. Currently, annotations are stored on learnify servers. The annotations saved on the database follow the W3 Model. The image below is an example of how image and text annotations are stored in our database.
    
  ![imageannot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64018144/206256739-c0594972-3d76-4b01-b383-0bbaea0965eb.jpg)

  **Image annotation**
    
  ![photo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64018144/206253615-7417e2c0-a835-46df-a3f9-16901faf8fbe.jpg)
    
  **Text annotation**

  And in this images you can see the models we do follow from W3 model.

  **Resource: https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-model/#index-of-json-keys**
  
  The API calls and examples are present on the postman documentation of the CREATE ANNOTATIONS endpoint. Please do check the link in [API Endpoints](https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-model/#index-of-json-keys) section of our milestone 2 report.
  
 ***
 
  #### Improvements in the Future
   **After our second demo, along with feedback we as a team see clearer on our mistakes on providing the universality and reusability of our annotations and we will do many improvements.** 
  These improvements will be:
   - Create microservice:
   
     We will create another service designed just to keep and return annotations and we will access it using axios library.
   - Change the request parameters on Create Annotation Endpoint:
   
     Although the annotations kept in the database and returned to the application fully obeys the W3 annotation model, the model sent by the application to the create annotation endpoint does not follow the same convention. In very near future, the annotation model sent by the application and get by the specification will be exactly the same and will be W3 annotation model.

### *Main Contributions:*
I am a member of our frontend team for the development of our application, namely Learnify. As I did in the first milestone, I continued to provide visual components of our web application according to the design guidelines we have determined together and in harmony with other components and pages of our web application. Before our weekly frontend team meetings I have regularly inspected our application's development's current state and provided necessary agenda for that week. I have also provided page layouts and visual components like icons, logos, or illustrations for our web application. I have also researched on icon library that we can use (Fontawesome) and implemented it so that the performance and loading times for our screens increase significantly by not trying to render each png file when loading. I have also researched n dynamic routing in React and provided an easy-to-use and effective solution to one of our biggest issues: overcoming hardcoding each url path in App.js. I have also provided a component based page layouting logic so that we can eaily import components and use them withouut repeating lines of code and be able to pass specific parameters to display components. Besides, I have implemented categories page, learning spaces by category page and semantic search component in the navigation bar. For each, I have implemented separate components, established backend connection, established dynamic routing and passed parameters to display components according to the response acquired from the REST API. I have also regularly provided css classes that satisfy our design guidelines for the components implemented by the whole frontend team. I have regularly helped my teammates to fix any erroneous part of their code, provided hotfixes, and tried to share them good practices that I have learned. Additionally, I have implemented unit tests for the components that I have created during the development of our web application’s frontend.

 - Widget tests for Create LS Screen: https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2022group2/blob/mobile/create-ls-tests/learnify/mobile/test/create_ls_test.dart
 * Create LS Screen tests have not been merged to the master branch as the futureInit() function used in this screen causes automated tests to fail. After 7-8 hours and 300+ lines of bug fixing attempts I gave up on it. The screen works and the tests are written properly. They just fail automated testing.

### *Member:*  

Name: Koray Tekin

Group: Group2 - Frontend Team

### *Responsibilities:*

  1. Searching for and using new methods throughout web-application development process
  2. Building the main layout for the Learning Space pages.
  3. Providing the initial back-end connection for the Learning Space pages.
  4. Providing component logic for our web application.
  5. Implementing the Static Navigation Bar component.
  6. Utilizing the components in the Learning Space page(modularization of the components via related end-points). 
  7. Implementing unit tests for the Static Footer component.
  8. Conducting research on React libraries, frameworks, and methodologies that will be used during our development process.
  9. Reviewing the works done by the frontend team.
  10. Creating search issues for the easier implementation of our projects functionalities. 
  11. Solving bugs, errors, problems encountered during the implementation of the frontend of our application regularly.
  12. Attending and participating general meetings regularly.
  13. Attending and participating frontend team meetings regularly.

### *Main Contributions:*
I am one of the members of the front-end team of our application Learnify, as a team of 4 we are implementing the web-application side. Throughout this development process we try not to diverge from the path that we follow for; deciding on "What is next?", sharig the tasks equally among our team members, keeping in touch with the team during the implementation, conducting research when needed, reviewing and commenting on each others work regularly and, finally making sure that our application functions as expected. I have taken responsibiity for all of these development steps time to time. Regularly participated to weekly meetings of our team and shared my point of view for the further developments that can be conducted for our web-application, at the same time those meetings are the time that we share each weeks tasks, so I have shared my mind about load balancing each week and took significant tasks that have effected the development of our application. While keeping in touch with the other team members both for the design and functionality ideas, first of all I have implemented the "Static Navigation Bar" components layout and the functionalty, implemented the layout and several of the components for the Learning Space pages which is one of the main pages of our web-application(where learning and sharing takes place.), contributed to our codebase with several hot-fixes related to the REST API utilization and router modularization. And as I have mentioned above, testing the work we have come up with was one of the important points, as we have done always in our front-end team; we have shared the designs and functionalities that were added and implemented the unit tests for those, my responsibility was to test the Footer component and I did so. Our team was also aware of the importance of conducting research together and share our findings with each other, I have created a research team issue for finding out the annotation technologies and libraries that our team can benefit from and shared my own findings via examples and hyperlinks with my team.
